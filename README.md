# Gitpod workspace for [Zoose PyTorch](https://databaseline.tech/pytorch-with-zoose-for-gitpod/)

Do you want to run PyTorch in your browser with either VSCode or JupyterLab, without installing _anything_?

1. Create an account on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io).
1. Click "Use this template" at the top right to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.
1. [Create a workspace](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/getting-started#start-your-first-workspace) in Gitpod from the repository you created in the previous step.
1. Enjoy a hosted notebook experience with VSCode and JupyterLab from your browser.

Zoose PyTorch also works with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/ianhellstrom/zoose-codespace).

## Limitations

Gitpod offers by default 4-core instances with 8GB RAM and 30GB storage.
You can [change the configuration](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes).
However, there are certain limitations to be aware of:
- No support for GPUs
- No support for distributed training
